Deploy

Commit all files to your GitHub repo (cca, branch Grok-Dev).
Ensure requirements.txt, senior_care_calculator_v5_full_with_instructions_ui.json, and senior_care_modular_overlay.json are in the repo root.
Point Streamlit Cloud to your branch and streamlit_app.py.
Verify the sidebar footer shows App v2025-09-03-rb13-no-reportlab-no-css.
If deployment fails, check Streamlit Cloud logs. Ensure requirements.txt is present, correctly formatted (Unix line endings, no extra whitespace), and includes streamlit>=1.31,<2 and altair>=5.0.1. Verify both JSON schema files are present and correctly formatted. If Step 3 fails, check for errors in currency input fields.
