# CHANGELOG

## vNext
- Progress bar + step pills at top of app (Step 1–4).
- Reinforced spouse/partner household income capture.
- VA A&A tier selector shows immediate impact preview.
- Home strategy unifies downstream UI (carry costs vs. sale proceeds vs. HECM/HELOC).
- Terminology pass: “Stay at Home (no paid care)” vs “In‑Home Care”.

- Renamed **Other liquid assets** to **Other savings & investments** in JSON spec for consistency with UI.
